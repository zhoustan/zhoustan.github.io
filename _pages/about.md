    <strong>🔥 I am actively looking for Ph.D. positions in Robotics and Computer Vision starting in Fall 2026.</strong>
</div>

I am a Master's student at the University of Zurich, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. Since August 2024, I have been working as a Student Researcher at the **Computer Vision Lab (CVL), ETH Zurich**, advised by Prof. Dr. [Guolei Sun](https://guoleisun.github.io/) and Dr. [Yawei Li](https://yaweili.bitbucket.io/).

My research aims to build **efficient and robust perception systems** for intelligent agents. Currently, I focus on:
* **Video Understanding:** Robust segmentation and object tracking in dynamic scenes (crucial for robot perception).
* **Efficient AI:** Model quantization and compression to enable foundation models on resource-constrained edge devices.
* **Embodied AI:** Bridging the gap between vision foundation models and robotic control.

Prior to my master's, I spent 3 years as an Algorithm Engineer at Servyou Group, where I specialized in building large-scale ML infrastructure and real-time deployment systems.
