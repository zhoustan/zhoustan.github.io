I am a master's student at the University of Zurich, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I have been working with [Guolei Sun](https://guoleisun.github.io/) and [Yawei Li](https://yaweili.bitbucket.io/) at CVL, ETH Zurich since Aug 2024, focusing on video understanding and quantization of foundation models.

My current research interests are computer vision, multimodal large language models, and quantization.

I'm looking for a PhD position starting from Sept 2026.
