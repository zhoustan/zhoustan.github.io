# WORK EXPERIENCE

## Servyou Software Group Co., Ltd.
### Algorithm Engineer, Hangzhou, China, Jun. 2019-Jul. 2022

#### 1. Machine Learning Platform
- **Description:** Based on Kubernetes, we designed a machine learning platform to build algorithmic solutions using flowcharts. This improved the efficiency of algorithm development and facilitated the deployment services and migration of algorithmic models.
- **My Contribution:** 
  - Implementation of the core compiler.
  - Implementation of some generic data processing components and algorithm components.

#### 2. Intelligent Customer Service (Project Leader)
- **Description:** Based on user consult data from the finance and tax sectors, built a question-and-answer bot based on the corpus, replacing most traditional human customer service answers. The robot achieved a 90% problem resolution rate and a low dissatisfaction rate of 3%.
- **My Contribution:** 
  - Natural Language Processing.
  - Implementing Q&A algorithms based on BERT.
  - Building multi-turn conversation dialogue flow based on intent recognition, slot recognition, etc.

#### 3. Image Recognition and OCR (Project Leader)
- **Description:** Implementation of system architecture and algorithms for image recognition and OCR to support the recognition of CAPTCHA in RPA.
- **My Contribution:** 
  - Used CNN+LSTM+CTC-LOSS, YOLO, Siamese Network, etc., to solve these problems.
  - Service supports a thousand levels of concurrency, and SLA meets 99.99%.
